## Agenda

### Will – Kauffman expected outcomes

People experienced in the fundraising suggest to have clear deliverables. In our case: livestream. But we need other RxC specific deliverables, like working groups. What 10 people can decide on. Key focal points in 3-9 months for the org. Will bring Jeff, Mar and Glen on this as well.

James: maybe conf is a place to start discussion. E.g. find sandboxes like Democracy Earth.

Will: standards for the projects/ideas to be included \(or excluded\). What is the quality of the work done so far? How much and what support we can provide for people \(e.g. implementation likelihood\). Radical journal is a deliverable of sorts.

Max: we can form a strategy with goals like [https://wiki.dgov.foundation/org/dgov-collaboration-strategy](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/org/dgov-collaboration-strategy) which was built from the workshop. We can use something like that. Also a deliverables map for the conf.

Will: need metrics for attendance, ratings, room for improvement.
