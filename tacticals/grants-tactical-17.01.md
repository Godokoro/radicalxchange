Bigger picture?

Will: can provide research. There’s a anti-corn league. $150k till April, $250k till the end of the year.

James: asking for specific deliverables \(conference\) seems more effective

Will: still allocating some funds for overhead is important, some funds understand that \(+10-20%\). E.g. for paying people as well.

Mary: lest write up the ideas \(like mentioned website section\)

### James

On Sloan – would be great to see previous submissions

Have we thought about how we select the scholars? Will: will ask about the criteria and get back.

Target number of scholars? Will: 30-60 tickets
