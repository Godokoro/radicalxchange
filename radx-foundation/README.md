# RadicalxChange Foundation

## Mission

RadicalxChange convenes a community of activists, artists, entrepreneurs and scholars committed to using dramatically expanded competitive, free and open market mechanisms to reduce inequality, build widely-shared prosperity, heal global political divides and build a richer and more cooperative social life.  
  
As advocates of radical social change, the RadicalxChange community challenges long-established social institutions such as private property, one-person-one-vote and the primacy of the individual on the one hand and the nation state on the other.  
  
To achieve this change the community seeks to increase public knowledge about the emancipatory potential of insights from the field of mechanism design, in dialog with a range of other academic fields such as computer science, philosophy and history, the communicative imagination of artists, the pragmatic ingenuity of entrepreneurs and the idealism of activists for social justice.

We are a community of activists, artists, entrepreneurs, and scholars committed to using mechanism design to inspire radical social change.

The RadicalXChange \( [http://radicalxchange.com](http://radicalxchange.com/) \) movement explores market mechanisms for equality and cooperation, inspired by Radical Markets \( [http://radicalmarkets.com/](http://radicalmarkets.com/) \).

We have four tracks within the RadicalxChange organization: Ideas and Research \(I+R\), Arts and Communications \(A+C\), Entrepreneurship and Technology \(E+T\), and Activism and Government \(A+G\).
