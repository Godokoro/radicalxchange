# History

In Spring of 2018, Glen Weyl, an economist, and Eric Posner, a legal scholar, published Radical Markets. It was a visionary and radical work of political economy, and it quickly gained a following and sparked the creation of dozens of startups, articles, and collaborations. One prominent fan was Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, who would go on to co-author multiple articles with Glen Weyl. Now, the movement is not centered around the book but rather the idea that market mechanisms can be used to decrease inequality, increase cooperation, and heal political divides. The community includes multiple local chapters in places like Detroit, Berlin, and Seattle, and will convene its first conference in Detroit, MI on March 22-24, 2019.
