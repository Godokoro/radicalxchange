## Longterm

We are aiming to catalyze a social movement analogous most closely to the Anti-Corn Law League and the Progressive Movement in the United States. In the 2-3 year time horizon, here are benchmarks for each of our four tracks:

### Arts and Communications

Have developed and disseminated educational programming at all levels in English. One film produced and two in production. Several songs with some non-trivial mass appeal written and recorded. Dozens of video and board game illustrating ideas available and beginning to have significant niche adoption.

### Activism and Government

1000 local and campus groups established with an average of 100 members on 6 continents. Data as Labor and antitrust ideas implemented in Europe and part of major party platform in United States. Technocratic adoption in many countries of narrow uses of COST and QV is a reasonably common method of local government decision-making and polling by major parties. A handful of political parties in wealthy countries either adopt or are founded on broad Liberal Radical framing.

### Entrepreneurship and Technology

Ideas have reached the prominence within technology circles that e.g. blockchain did in 2017. Widely used for resource allocation or decision-making inside medium-sized and some larger technology companies. Beginning to spread to more traditional companies. Several start-ups based primarily on the ideas have achieved non-trivial success; total estimated market capitalization of companies primarily known for working on RxC ideas ~$20 billion. Most prominent mechanisms are now familiar to most of the public in wealthy countries from using technology and can easily be adopted in a DIY manner.

### Ideas and Research

RxC is recognized as an emerging knowledge cluster similar to the position of Data Science in ~2012. The publishing model of the RxC Intellectual Commons project is being adopted in many other fields and is viewed as prestigious at the level of a top journal within a discipline. Top intellectuals from most relevant allied fields are contributing significant ideas to the RxC project on a regular basis. 50-100 papers closely relevant to RxC are published in top journals in specific disciplines each year. Fraction of central RxC ideas that appeared in Radical Markets is down to 10%.
