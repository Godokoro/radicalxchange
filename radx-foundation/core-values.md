# Core Values

**Open:** RadicalxChange is open. It seeks to facilitate a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.  
  
**Egalitarian:** Many of the ideas at RadicalxChange are animated by a belief that hyper-concentrations of wealth are not natural or efficient, and that a more genuinely competitive market system would result in a broader distribution of wealth.  
  
**Dignity:** Every personâ€™s well-being \(financial or otherwise\) is a good in itself. We want our work to reflect and express this.  
  
**Social Innovation:** At RadicalxChange we embrace the challenge of overturning stale categories and assumptions! We believe that thoughtful, collaborative innovation can help build better social institutions.
