## Agenda

**Will / Sloan** – intended to fund scholarships \(flights + accommodation\) +85 discount tickets

**Will / IRS Database** – there's a list of potential sponsors.

**Will** / James and Will will look into Ford foundation.

**Max / Grant Strategy**  
Will: we shouldn't allocate for community building because of our status, need to find other way to support them. Can include some type of hackathon \(blockchain dev, DAO, licenses, self assed tax\) – any ideas that come out of the conference. People that will be proposing: Will, Matt, Jeff and Glen. Then we support to the board  
James: good, maybe a shortlist the number of programs we want to select

**Max / Any help needed?**  
James and Mary can work on Ford + list.

**James / Sloan foundation**  
We've talked about Atlas. What's the difference between the letter and application.  
Will: application explains what the funds are used for. But we're not asking for a lot.

**James / What is the major work in this direction**  
Please add to the doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/180ypw-6GftnYDctBFZHLO80fmCmQCM2PIzXaSqOm9Q0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/180ypw-6GftnYDctBFZHLO80fmCmQCM2PIzXaSqOm9Q0/edit)

**James / who's builder**  
Will: top tech, activists, community. Will ask Glen about priority.
